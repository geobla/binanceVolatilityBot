## 1. Create a Virtual Environment.
   
To create a virtual environment in Python, you can use the venv module, which is included in Python 3.3 and later. Here's how to create a virtual environment:
- Open your command prompt or terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
  You can use the cd command to change directories.
  For example:
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/your/directory
  ```
 - Once you are in the desired directory, run the following command to create a virtual environment.
   You can replace myenv with the name you want to give your virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   ```
   This command will create a directory named myenv (or the name you specified) in your current directory.
   Inside this directory, the virtual environment will be set up.

- To activate the virtual environment, you'll need to use the appropriate activation command based on your operating system:
  - On Windows:
  ```bash
  myenv\Scripts\activate
  ```
